Today, the Musée Thivierge is no longer confined to Bren Hall 3031, but is instead spread across Bren Hall in the curators' offices. All inhabitants of Bren Hall are welcome to become curators and add their exhibit(s) to the collection at the esteemed Musée Thivierge. Exhibits are documented in the exhibits tab on this website and can be seen by appointment, drop in, or scheduled exhibitions, which are announced through word of mouth.
