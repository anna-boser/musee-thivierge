The Mus√©e Thivierge started in 2019 when founder and at the time PhD student Vincent Thivierge gave his first exposition of his exhibit on the history of the ancient Goleta Bay in his office at Bren Hall 3031. During his time at Bren, people would frequently drop in to sign into the museum, see his exhibit, and enjoy some snacks or a cup of tea. When Vincent graduated in 2023 and went off to do great things, the museum lay dormant for a year, before being revived by curators Elliott Finn, Anna Boser, and Tracey Mangin at the historic grand re-opening on October 3, 2024.
